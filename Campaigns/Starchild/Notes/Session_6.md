# Summary
Last episode, our edgerunners took on a mission for [[Stephen]]. They ventured to East [[Black Moonlight|BM]], into [[Eldar]] territory, where they hunted for and found [[Edric Rogerton]]. Upon *encountering* him they grappled and embarassed him a bit untill he handed over his notebook.

Afterwards, [[Cayote]] took his abrupt exit with a message to the group chat, leaving [[N0rt0n]] with [[Ares]] in [[CircuitCrafters]]. Before heading back to [[Svides Bar]].
