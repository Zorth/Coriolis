# Summary
Last episode, the Starchild edgerunners cleared the [[Megabuilding H07]] making their way up to the penthouse. There they encountered the last of the creatures inhabiting the megabuilding. They found some good loot and returned to [[The Continental]], in order to receive their [[Continental Coin]].
Now they prepare for their next job, having access to [[The Continental]]'s services.
