# Summary
Last episode the tag team of [[Lock]] and [[V-King]] spent their time prepping and ambushing the [[Eldar]] transport of [[Takumi|Kaito Takumi]]. After absolutely destroying the transport, especially their arms, they got the cryopump. They got [[Takumi]] unfrozen at [[NeuraForge]] and afterwards went out drinking with him in [[Svides Bar]], fishing for information.
