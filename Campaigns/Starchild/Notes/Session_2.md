- [x] [[Maelstrom]] ambush

# Log

# Summary
After contacting their loved ones, and most getting a recommendation of therapy, our band of edgerunners found out they have fallen in the targets of [[Maelstrom]]. Secondly, trying to decrypt the ominous orange chip they've come into possession of. They explored their options. [[Silverlight]] seemed to know somebody but has no clue of where they are. Through [[J3N]] you've got 2 options, meet up with [[BinaryBard]] and pay the 2k eb to decrypt the chip; Or, do a job for [[Shochu]] in [[Star Park]]. On top of that, you've been offered a data job on [[Arthur Hawthorne]] in [[Black Moonlight|CBM]].
