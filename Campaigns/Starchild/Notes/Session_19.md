# Summary
Last episode, our edgerunners started on their job to acquire a [[Continental Coin]]. After some short preparations, they head over to [[Megabuilding H07]], where the made acquaintances with [[UIT]]. After a trip to the basement, they were able to restore power to the building. Reviving the decrepit building to a semblance of functioning, or maybe even life.

Nevertheless, they carried on to block 1 of the megabuilding. The shopping mall. Where they were about to walk into an ambush, but they seem to have gotten the drop on the somewhat suspecting inhabitants. After getting into positions and distracting, shots are fired. Initiative is rolled.
