# Summary
On last episode, the crew went to [[J3N]]'s night market, celebrating the new year. But this event was soured by the preceding events as [[J3N]] had been murdered. The question still stands of who did it, and what for. But regardless, as the our edgerunners geared up for their next mission: To locate the demon [[Iris Levy|Lilith]] and arrange a meeting between her and [[Stephen]]. Next on the docket, finding [[The Black Robes]]' contact in [[Black Moonlight]].
