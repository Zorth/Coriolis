# Summary
Last episode, the newly dubbed *Shadow Wizard Money Gang*, found a new figure: [[M0NSIEUR]]; In their prized [[Svides Bar]] talking to [[Sterling]]. After a short introductory conversation, he joined them and was to be "tested" by getting rid of [[Silverlight]].

After a change of plans when retrieving [[Silverlight]] from [[Moonwheels]], they instead opted to hand her over to [[Stephen]]. They then headed for [[The Black Robes]] contact after their new companion was able to decipher the riddle to be referring to Future Bridge. After finding the [[Mechanosophy|Mechanosofists]]' church and being ambushed. They learned the next key piece of information to find [[Iris Levy|Lilith]]. As well as a small gift from [[Father Malachi Darkthorne]].
