Blamed slot fiasco on [[Brandon Dickens]].
[[Aurora Veloce X9]] won by [[N0rt0n]] driving in a [[RRB]], bet against [[Arthur Hawthorne]] and friends.
# Summary
Last episode, our edgerunners completed a data-job on [[Arthur Hawthorne]]. They accomplished this by advertising a fake advertisement for the [[BET]] slots, through [[Red Vix]]. This lured [[Arthur Hawthorne|Arthur]] and his [[TRE]] friends down, which allowed [[N0rt0n]] to bet him on a street-race, resulting, thanks to the distractions by [[V-King]], in an [[Aurora Veloce X9]] won. This, unfortunately didn't get them the chip quite yet. Which led to [[Silverlight]] sneaking into the garage and pick-pocketing the chip.
