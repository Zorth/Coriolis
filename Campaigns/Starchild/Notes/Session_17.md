# Summary
Last episode, our edgerunners picked up on their own running job of finding [[Kabutar]]. This lead to them meeting a new fixer, [[D0LL]]. Various dealings and downtime activities eventually ended up in them visiting [[R1pt2d3]]'s mother where they extorted his and his mother's safety for information on the cyber-bird. This gave them the location of where [[R1pt2d3]] delivered the bird. A building owned by some [[Maelstrom]] [[Mechanosophy|Mechanosofists]] that worship [[Ebros]].
