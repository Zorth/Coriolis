# Summary
Last episode, our edgerunners spent some time doing side jobs, going to therapy and recuperating. After the heat had settled a bit, they met with a potential client [[Stephen|Stephen Argive]] which went decently enough to be offered their next job. To retrieve a notebook, yes an actual paper book, of an individual named [[Edric Rogerton]].
