# Summary
On last episode, our band of edgerunners infiltrated Central [[Black Moonlight]], also known as CBM. There they met up and struck a deal with [[Green Shade]] in order to help them on their mission to steal a scroll belonging to [[Eleanor Skyword]]. Setting up a [[Red Vix]] concert as a way in.
