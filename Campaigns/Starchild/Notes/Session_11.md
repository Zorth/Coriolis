# Summary
On the last episode. The Shadow wizard money gang recuperated from their wounds, met with the new [[Kage|big fixer]] of North [[Black Moonlight|BM]], signed [[BIINJOOS|big contracts]], and went to visit the [[Father Malachi Darkthorne]]. After their dealings and latest research into the death of [[J3N]], they have decided to prepare and head to [[Fjord]]. Setting a course westwards through [[ARGUS]] territory, venturing north as to avoid the open ocean and then south-westwards towards [[Fjord]] itself.
