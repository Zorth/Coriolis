# Summary
Last episode, our edgerunners prepared and went through [[Hubble Con]]. First meeting with [[Great Lora]] to see if they could track down the origin of the death threats sent to [[8-Bit]]. The event went fairly smoothly, with visits from fans and business associates alike. But afterwards, however, the party was ambushed by target of [[N0rt0n]], a.k.a. [[Kuro]]'s best friend. Except not anymore, apparently.
