# Summary
Last episode, our edgerunners made their way back from [[Fjord]] to [[Black Moonlight]]. Following their lead up on [[The Mask]], who had newly taken over their acquaintance "*[[Brent Williams|Kevin]]*". Once back home, they went to gather some more information about the current situation. Talking to various sources, they figured out traces of [[The Mask]] leading to a set of warehouses in harbor town.
