> There have been a series of wars the past half a century, over territory and market share. But out of the fights a dystopian world of powerful corporations and weak individuals was born.
> But, we zoom in to the smaller scheme of things. In the north of Black Moonlight.

# Summary
Last session, you were all called to a job on short notice. A job for which no one else was available.

You each had your reasons for taking this job, with these people [[J3N]] recommended. Even though you might have heard some good, or bad things about these people, this job all left you a little scarred with the horrid truths of living in a metropolis like [[Black Moonlight]].

You all got payed, and got payed well. Along with finding some supplies and not the least of which, data.

2 conversations between [[Huggyhands]] and other people and a very important looking orange chip which is encrypted.
