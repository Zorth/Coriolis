# Summary
In last episode, our edgerunners followed up the trail of [[The Mask]], leading them to 2 warehouses. One, formerly operated by [[Sylvaray]], where they found [[Imp]]s and bloody trails leading to the [[Amp Spark]] where [[Kay_Tee]] will be performing soon; The other, currently still operated by [[TRE]] where a private investigator squad was looking into *something*, there they overhead employees of the same [[Amp Spark]] bar have been going missing.
