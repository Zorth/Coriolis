# `= this.aliases[1]`
[[8-Bit]] is a [[Media]] lifestyle and paranormal reporter on the popular [[Madia|Madian]] platform [[Hubble]].

They make vlogging & video essay content on their [[Hubble Bubble]] as well as frequenting different forums and the occasional stream on [[Hubble Telescope]].

Their content is mainly corporate takedown and paranormal focussed; being very open and ethical about the validity of their statements.

## History
They grew up in Central [[Black Moonlight]] with their parents who worked for [[Starburst]] as corporate technicians. They are still quite close with their parents even though they don't approve of [[8-Bit]]'s independent career goals, as they're not doing great financially. Growing up in the [[Starburst]] culture, one of [[8-Bit]]'s idols was and still is [[Foranko Loriel]], reporter of [[Flash Report]]; of whom he still carries a signed polaroid picture.

Their parents' connection with [[B4nk]] led to a close friendship with [[S0ng]] growing up which they still maintain as [[8-Bit]] ventures around. As their passion for retro gear developed they also acquainted themselves with [[Zita]], a scrap dealer in North [[Black Moonlight|BM]] who's provided them with spare parts and old school gear.

In their reporting efforts they've completed a couple of minor jobs for [[J3N]] as they needed to get by. They've also gotten caught and developed somewhat of a bond with [[The Architect|Anthony Scott]] of [[The Continental]], as they were snooping st celebrities and possible paranormal activities.

## Connections
They've soured relations with [[Kristal Fetamine]], a recruiter/manager for [[Starburst]]. As their parents setup an interview for a job, but [[8-Bit]]'s performance during the interview angered [[Kristal Fetamine|Kristal]] as [[8-Bit]]'s goals did not align with the company's policies & mission statement.

They're actively competing with [[S1mp]] on [[Hubble]]. As [[S1mp]] has taken a disliking to [[8-Bit]]'s "faked content". They may have gang affiliations.

Their late boyfriend [[Pixel-8]] ([[Pixel-8|Koda Young]]) died in a tragic accident. [[Pixel-8]] was a fan of [[8-Bit]] before starting their short lived career in the same field. The love was a bit one-sided and [[8-Bit]] still feels guilty because of it.
