> [!Info] Rumor True
> Although V-King is associated with Moonwheels, he often rides alone making him an easier target to double cross or someone you can strike a more profitable deal with.

> [!Info] Rumor Mixed
> V-King's old family fell apart due to a failed heist that he was in.

> [!Info] Rumor False
> V-King lost his arms in a dispute between him and the Moonwheels. They tore off his arms to teach him a lesson.
