## [[Ember]] Arc
The [[Ember]] Arc is about saving [[Ember]] from her fate. Either as duty to the [[Eldar]] (which she doesn't want), as a battery to the [[Pearl of Power|PoP]] (which would kill her), or in a lab of any of the major corporations (namely [[ARGUS]]).

| [[Silverlight]]         | [[Cayote]]       | [[N0rt0n]]                                       | [[V-King]]  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Dealing with [[Barrie]] | [[ARGUS]] Bounty | [[ARGUS]]' involvement in [[Dara Disappearance]] | Cyberpsycho |
### Finding the bounty target ([[Silverlight]])
A [[Red Vix]] concert leads to [[Nina Wetherstone|Nina]] being abducted and eventually murdered by [[Huggyhands]]. She was visiting the concert together with her mother [[Helen Waro]].

Some of the fans have spotted the creep but don't know who he is. It can be found out that it is [[Maelstrom]] though. [[J3N]] can give contact info of a [[Maelstrom]] contact, [[Wa-Yers]]. He frequents the [[Amp Spark]] bar. He will sell the info for 200 eb.

### [[Huggyhands|Frenlor's]] bounty
![[Huggyhands#^infobox|right]][[J3N]] gives the bounty on [[Huggyhands]], who's wanted for child trafficking. The bounty is DoA 2,500 eb upon proof of completion and delivering his personal computer, BD's & datashards. They should find out his routine and complete the job.

[[Huggyhands]] is currently laying low in [[Reiker Studio]]. He sends out one of his goons to gather supplies and other things. He however has a meeting with [[Great Lora]] in a couple of days to discuss the whereabouts of [[Ember]].

He was tipped off by [[Barrie]] about [[Nina Wetherstone|Nina]], who wanted to shatter [[Red Vix]]'s reputation. 

#### [[Reiker Studio]]
[[Reiker Studio]] is [[Huggyhands]]' current hideout, they can choose to ambush him here and get away with the spoils.

This leaves hooks to:
- [[Ember]]
- [[Barrie]]
- Dealings with [[ARGUS]]
- [[Great Lora]] ([[Eldar]])

### [[Eldar]] religious goals
The players have found the hook to [[Ember]], they will discover the importance of her by exploring how:
- [[Pearl of Power|PoP]] (through [[Eldar]]) wants her to extract the [[Arca Energy]].
- The [[Aegis Vanguard]] ([[Arcane Veil]]) wants to recruit her to slay monsters. 
- [[The Black Robes]] want her to help with [[The Opening of the Portals]].
- And [[ARGUS]] wants to perform experiments on her and discover [[Kami]] powers.
- [[Ember|She]] is just a kid that doesn't know what she wants.

## [[Iris Levy|Lilith]] arc
![[Iris Levy#^infobox|right]] The party is hired by [[Stephen]] to find [[Iris Levy|Lilith]] so that he can "meet" her.

The party follow up on [[The Mask]], a [[Woven Relic]] that absorbs all [[Arca Energy]] of its host and therefore erases them from history. Because [[Iris Levy|Iris]] is after that same artifact. However [[Bahamut Levy|The Emperor]] has arrived on [[Madia]] and so [[Iris Levy|Iris]] has fled, leaving [[Pearl of Power|The Pearl of Power]] to get the relic. Once the party has secured the relic they will decide what to do with it. Here are a couple of options:
- Give to the [[Vitalis Corps]] for help on finding [[Rav3n]]
	- Keeping it out of the hands of the [[Pearl of Power|PoP]] will give them info on [[Rav3n]]
- Selling it to [[Great Lora]] for 4k/p
- Giving it to [[Iris Levy|Iris]] or [[Bahamut Levy|Bahamut]] Directly
- Giving it to [[Edric Rogerton]] of the [[Aegis Vanguard]]

Following this they will decide to be with or against [[Iris Levy|Iris]]. Either finding [[Breeze Levy|Breeze]] to help with the fight against her, or trying to take down [[Bahamut Levy|Bahamut]].
### [[Continental Coin]]
Major job raiding the [[Megabuilding H07]], which will give them a [[Continental Coin]].
This will give them access to [[TechnoBlade]] who has a job to retrieve his [[Sharpness V]], a woven relic secured by [[ARGUS]].

-> This will lead to them investigation the [[Woven Relic]]s under [[ARGUS]] control.
### [[GHNS]]
The [[GHN]] Scanner used by [[Sterling]] is another means of giving them hints towards [[Iris Levy|Iris]] and the greater legends of [[Lost Syndicate|The Lost]].
