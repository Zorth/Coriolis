[[Using Incantations|Incanting]] or [[Using Incantations|Casting]], is the process of using an [[Incantation]].

The process is divided up into 2 steps:
1. [[#Defining the incantation]]
2. [[#Drawing a card]]


# Defining the incantation 
In order to define the cant perform the following:
1. Declare the spell level (type, name and/or modifiers if applicable).
2. Declare the desired cant outcome. 

Depending on the parameters, your GM might not allow you to cast the cant. As the outcome must match the attributes written in the spell.

In case you attempt to cant something with expansive outcomes, your GM might warn you of the side-effects or consequences of failure.

# Drawing a card
Next draw a card from the Magic Deck and lay it down in front of you. Pulled cards should always remain visible to everyone.

There are two factors that determine the outcome. Those being the suit and the value.

## Suits
The drawn card is either On-suit or Off-suit depending on the [[spell]]. Drawing a card on suit means your [[Vasl]] takes a point of [[Entropy]]. Below is a table of each [[Writing Spells#Type|Spell Type]] and their suit in a standard deck.

| Type        | Suit     |
| ----------- | -------- | 
| Physical    | Spades             |
| Organic     | Clovers            |
| Soul        | Hearts            |
| Dimensional | Diamonds |

Jokers do not have a suit.

## Value
There are 54 cards in the deck, the GM might choose to remove or add any number of jokers. Below is a table of their effects.

| Value | Effect |
| ---- | ---- |
| Ace | **[[#Critical Success]].** |
| 2-10 | If the card is equal to or below the [[Writing Spells#Level\|Spell level]], the spell **Succeeds**. Otherwise the spell **Fizzles** and your [[Vasl]] gains 1 point of [[Entropy]]. |
| Jack | The spell **Backfires**. the desired effect affects you instead. |
| King | The spell **Backfires**. the desired effect affects you instead. *And* you gain 1 [[Entropy]]. |
| Queen | [[#Losing The Incantation\|Lose the Incantation]]. |
| Joker | **[[#Critical Failure]]**. |
^ValueEffectTable
### Critical Success
The spell succeeds optimally, use the noted critical success. Otherwise, double the dice or effect of the spell. Otherwise, a suitable effect happens, like regaining luck.
### Losing The Incantation
The [[Incantation]] is removed from the [[Vasl]] and thus the [[Incantation|Cant]] is unable to be used again.
A [[Incantation]] can only be lost when a spell backfires. Or another special circumstance that would remove the [[Incantation|Cant]] from the [[Vasl]].
### Critical Failure
The spell fails critically, use the noted critical failure. Otherwise, roll 1d12, lose that much HP and HUM.
