Spells are defined by their [[#Level]], [[#Type]] and [[#Modifiers]]. These factors define the correct writing of a spell.
# Base Modal
Each spell starts with this base. It may be embellished or stylized but it should essentially always be the root 3 circles and 6 directional lines.

These elements have the following names. The circles are called from inner to outer: heart, moon, body. The **True lines**, *True North* and *True South* (North on top, South at the bottom), they run vertically; The **Offensive Lines**, *Entry* (top right) and *Exit* (bottom left), run diagonally from the upper right to the bottom left; The **Defensive Lines**, *Palm* (top left) and *Fist* (bottom right), run diagonally from the bottom right to the top left.

# Type
The type symbol is drawn on top of the [[#Base Modal]]. These can be combined in the event that a spell has multiple types. Below are the types in order: Physical, Organic, Soul, Dimensional.

# Refined Level
## Level 1 - Base
Level is the [[#Base Modal]] and the [[#Type]]. This has the lowest success rate and can be used to describe anything. It is never used outside of teachings.
## Level 2  - Cornerstones
Level 2 is done by surrounding the outer circle in a hexagon and adding 6 circles on its points. These dots are the cornerstones.

## Level 3 - Type modifiers
Level 3 is accomplished by adding the correct type modifiers in the cornerstones, this essentially define the spell as each symbol carries the meaning of a target, element, attribute, etc. of the spell. To figure which modifiers are applicable, see [[modifier dictionary|the dictionary]].

Writing a 3rd level spell reveals the description & success effect.
## Level 4 - Power Level
Spells are either level-less in which case they have the 0-level glyph (below); Or spells have a power level from 1-6 (glyphs below), this also mostly increases the risky-ness of a spell.

Writing a 4th level spell reveals the critical succes effect.
## Level 5 - Tiering
Level 5 is done by following each of the 6 directional lines of the [[#Base Modal]] and counting the amount of lines that "go out" of the spell between two directional lines in a clockwise fashion. This number is then written in [[Tiering]] on the directional line (on the CCW side).

Here is an example of tiering on a simplified physical spell: ![[Phys_level3.svg|wsmall center]]

Writing a 5th level spell reveals the backfire effect.
## Level 6 - Modifier antennae
The Antennae are lines outside of the the base modal. The amount of lines is equal to the amount of modifiers used to define the spell, and the end of the lines end in an amount of dots equal to the refined level of a spell.

Writing a 6th level spell reveals the critical failure effect.
## Level 7 - Binding Circle
The binding circle is drawn around the modifier, going through the cross-section of the root-lines and the antennae.

Writing a 7th level spell reveals the binding to the scribe.
## Level 8 - 

## Level 9 - 

## Level 10 -
