[[Refuge Falls]] is a hamlet not too far away from [[Aldinaskr]]. It used to be a mining town but is now best known for its small chapel. It was occupied by the [[Crystal Reclaimers|Reclaimers]] whilst they were looking for dragon eggs.

Behind the waterfall lies a [[The Door Leads Nowhere|Door that leads nowhere]].
