The [[Phoenix]] is the spiritual leader and mascot of the [[Eldar]] religion. It is held by a long line of a [[Kami]] family.

The [[Phoenix]] has several duties within the church of [[Eldar]]. 

# Rituals
## Ascension Ritual
The ascension ritual is the ritual performed by the new [[Phoenix]] when they assume the duties in the church. It is a big celebration where many things are offered to the [[Phoenix]]-to-be.

After a long ceremony, often lasting more than a single day, it ends with the [[Phoenix]] putting on the [[Phoenix' bracelets]].

## Seclusion Ritual
The seclusion ritual is the last ritual performed by a [[Phoenix]] before ending their duties. It can only be performed after it has produces an heir who is ready for ascension. This long ritual ends with the [[Phoenix]] taking of their [[Phoenix' bracelets]] and being therefore absorbed into them.
