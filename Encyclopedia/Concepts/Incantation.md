An [[Incantation]] is a [[Spell]] that is stored in a [[Vasl]]. It's often described as a parasite or something living inside with a mind of its own, as opposed to knowledge or "*learning a spell*".

For example, a magic user might convert a [[Fire Person]] *[[Spell]]* into an *[[Incantation]]*, storing it in their brain as a [[Vasl]], to be able to [[Using Incantations|Cast]] the spell.

Converting a [[Spell]] consumes the medium upon which the spell was written.

An [[Incantation]], is stored in a person's [[Vasl]] until it is lost.
