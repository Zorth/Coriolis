It felt dark, even though it wasn't.

[[Obermut]] had fallen to his knees, orb in hand. We had spent years waiting for this, working for this. And here it was. Victory.

We stood upon the deck of [[The Veneration]], with only the stars as our witness. The president of [[Olympus|Sol]] was dead, and the multiverse was saved.

[[Jarghull Nabaal|Jarghull]] lay dead at his feet, delivering the final blow at the cost of his own life. After all, [[Obermut]] had committed genocide on his planet. This was more than vengeance.

[[Katara Cybele|Katara]] had retreated into the spectral realm while she still could. Her physical form could barely hold her anyways.

[[Filthel Xarbroth|Filthel]] and [[Bonfire Tamosh|Bonfire]] were bleeding but alive. They sat a little further ahead from me, depleted and hurt.

[[Enys]] looked at me, her eyes glinting with worry as she felt it. The archwizard of *the Heroes* knew what was coming.

[[Skarsnik]] revealed himself from his hiding spot. And yelled out something in fear. He was disappearing. First his toes, his fingers, his hands. Slowly. Fading into the domain of the dead.

[[Axton-Firth IronsWorth|Axton]] frantically looked around, he was putting everything together. He knew what was happening, he knew it was because of his deal. I think we all kind off knew. And it was fine, we saved everyone else, right?

This was it. The space between spaces closed, the gates were shut. All travel between worlds was broken. We knew the gods had died then, those who could not seal themselves to never be saved. I stood there, bow in hand, pulling the edges of the fading magic to keep everything we had from collapsing but alas, I couldn't. [[The Veneration]] crashed to the surface of the planet, we now know as [[Boubinia]].

This was the day the [[Magnificent Misfits]] died.
