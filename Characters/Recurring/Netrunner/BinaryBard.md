Lydia "BinaryBard" Voss is an enigmatic [[Netrunner]] for hire in the cyberpunk underworld of North [[Black Moonlight]]. With her sharply styled short brown hair and a penchant for formal attire, she presents an air of professionalism that belies her true role as a digital renegade. Her backstory is a tapestry of intrigue, as she once worked for [[Sylvaray]], utilizing her prodigious coding skills for their gain. However, disillusioned by the company's cutthroat methods, she broke free, embracing the underground life as a [[Netrunner]]. Now, she operates on her terms, taking on clandestine hacking missions that involve infiltrating the city's most secure networks, all while maintaining her own code of ethics in a world where loyalty is a rare commodity.
