# `= this.aliases[1]`
Shochu, once [[Cayote]]'s friend, now a fierce tech rival aligned with the [[Kuro]] gang, is renowned for her expertise in encryption technology. Her distinctive features include pale white skin, thin, calculating eyes, and slicked-back red-brown hair, adding an air of intrigue to her formidable presence in North [[Black Moonlight]]'s tech world.

[[Shochu]] and [[Cayote]] grew up under [[Ares]] as friendly rivals. Whilst [[Cayote]] was smarter, [[Shochu]] was more cunning. Often stealing and tricking her way into "victories". This led to her taking a deal with [[Kuro]] for her own shop, in exchange of ratting [[Vultures]] out to [[Stephen|Stephen Argive]]. Releasing her from the ties of [[Vultures]], but also maker her their enemy.

In truth, she's very jealous of [[Cayote]]. Who always seems to be able to do things she's not able to, whilst she has to resort to other people and trickery.
### Residence
She has her own shop, [[CipherTech]], where she lives.
# Connections
[[Kuro]] gang manager, she answers to [[Yugen]].
