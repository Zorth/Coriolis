# `= this.aliases[1]`
[[Sterling]] is a [[Netrunner]] for hire. She is a crazy, curious, and lonely person suffering from delusional episodes.

She refuses to use guns; As her best friend, Stibbels, commited suicide with a firearm. In actuality, Stibbles was a hard plastic garden gnome that she shot in a psychotic episode.

She has never known her biological parents growing up in the wilds of [[Saet]]. But a wandering [[Iris Levy]] has rescued her from dying of starvation and taught her basic means of survival for the first 10 years of her life. A blip in [[Iris Levy|Iris']] lifetime but everything to [[Sterling|Sam]]'s. Inheriting her adoptive mother's inhuman curiosity.

Because of [[Iris Levy|Iris]]' education she learned how to be a great [[Netrunner]]. And quickly excelled at it.

Because of her youth, she often tries to make friends but she scares them off quickly.
### Residence
