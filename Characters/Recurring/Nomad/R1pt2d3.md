R1pt2d3, a formidable Nomad hailing from the [[Moonwheels]] family, stands as a dissenting voice within the family's ranks, holding reservations about the family's current leadership, [[Steelfist]]. A physically imposing figure, he possesses a robust and muscular build, his strength only augmented by his cybernetic jaw and arms. R1pt2d3 commands significant influence in [[Black Moonlight]] as the mastermind behind the family's most substantial smuggling operations. His following within the Moonwheels family, which shares his concerns, adds an element of complexity to the family's intricate power dynamics and alliances in this dystopian realm.
