Ares, the [[Tech]] Maestro of North [[Black Moonlight]], is a tech guru with a shop in the city. He's shorter than most, has vivid pink skin, sports short brown hair, a full beard, and is perpetually seen with his trusty blue bag of tools. Ares has spent a lifetime mastering technology, breathing life into old machines, and mentoring aspiring technophiles like [[Cayote]]. His workshop is a hub of innovation in the bustling cyberpunk city.
### Residence
Proprietor of [[CircuitCrafters]].

# Connections
[[Ares]] used to be part of the stockholder family of [[ARGUS]] ([[Argive]]). Being the younger brother to [[Stephen|Stephen Argive]], he was not meant for bigger functions and was placed in charge of tech. But, with [[ARGUS]]' priority being their spy network, he often got shut down which led to him leaving the family business.
