Bungr, a mysterious presence in [[Black Moonlight]], is a [[Daru]] man with distinctive, long, silvery hair and high-tech cyber-ears resembling headphones, highlighting his connection to the world of sound. His most eye-catching feature is a metallic plate running centrally along his head, giving the appearance of an almost mohawk-like design, hinting at a concealed past. Behind an enigmatic fa√ßade, Bungr harbors undisclosed motives, all while keeping his role in the [[Dara]] family's [[Dara Disappearance|disappearance]] hidden from the prying eyes of the city's dystopian underworld, leaving observers to speculate about his true intentions.
