Eleanor Skyword, a high-ranking corporate executive under the [[Sylvaray]] banner, is a notorious figure in the dystopian world of [[Black Moonlight]]. Her reputation for ruthlessness is unmatched, driven by an unyielding ambition to see her company's profits soar, no matter the cost. She wields her power with a cold and calculated demeanor, stopping at nothing to achieve her goals. Eleanor's sinister legacy is marked by the deliberate closure of essential institutions such as raceways, hospitals, and community centers, resulting in widespread suffering and despair among the city's residents. Her unwavering commitment to corporate interests at the expense of the populace has earned her a place among the most feared and reviled figures in this cyberpunk realm.
