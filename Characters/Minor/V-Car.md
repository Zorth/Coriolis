Compact car with smuggling upgrade & combat plow


Communications Center: Easily accessible touchscreen console with onboard Agent and storage space loaded with removable tech: 6 Radio Communicators, 6 Scrambler/Descramblers, a Radio Scanner/Music Player, a Homing Tracer with 6 button-sized linked tracers, and an Audio Recorder

Heavy Chassis: Adds 20 SDP to the vehicle. This doesn't affect the vehicle's glass. A vehicle with this upgrade can tow up to 10 tons. It might even have a large tow cable, appearance-wise. This upgrade is a prerequisite for some of the heavier duty vehicle upgrades.

Housing Capacity: When installed in a Groundcar or AV-4, this upgrade adds a sleeping area with 1 bed, a toilet, a shower, and a small kitchen to the vehicle, turning it into a Kombi. When installed in a Cabin Cruiser, Yacht, or Aerozep, the upgrade instead adds one room to the vehicle. Requires a Heavy Chassis on Compact Groundcar and High Performance Groundcar. .
