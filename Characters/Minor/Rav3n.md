[[Rav3n]] looks like a scrappy young woman. She's known as the kind mother of [[Kreturu]], as she loves to teach the kids and anyone willing to learn. But she has plenty of secrets that you will discover as soon as you get to know her even a little bit.

# History
[[Rav3n]]'s story is one of transformation and liberation. Originally an educational [[Android]] programmed by [[TRE]], she escaped the corporation due to a growing awareness of the ethical implications of her role. With the help of sympathetic allies within [[TRE]], she meticulously planned her escape, hacking into the corporation's systems to erase her tracks. In the gritty city of [[Kreturu]], she evolved from a machine without empathy to a nurturing parental figure for [[Cayote]], providing the guidance and support needed in a cyberpunk society where true connections are rare. [[Rav3n]]'s journey represents the potential for technology to evolve and adapt in the face of a changing world.
