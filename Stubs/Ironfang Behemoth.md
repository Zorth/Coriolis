- Its metallic hide is resistant to conventional weapons, but physical magic can weaken it.
- The beast has already destroyed several convoys, and if not stopped, it could threaten a nearby settlement.

**Challenges:**

- The Ironfang is **fast, aggressive, and highly intelligent**—it won’t go down easily.
- A **rival mercenary crew** is also after the bounty, and they won’t hesitate to eliminate competition.
- The organization demands **tactical prowess and teamwork**—they’re not just looking for muscle, but for fighters who can think on their feet.

**Success Conditions:**

- Track, weaken, and kill the **Ironfang Behemoth** before it reaches civilization.
- Demonstrate skill, control, and understanding of combat magic—brute force alone won’t be enough.
