#plot

Raid on [[ARGUS R&D lab 616B]] for [[Sharpness V]]. In service of [[TechnoBlade]] for a reward of 1 M§.

# The Plan
- Pickup [[Erik Holmstrand]]'s keycard, and drop him off with [[Moonwheels]] (10k§)
- Create a distraction by uploading a slanderous video on an [[ARGUS]] facility to [[Hubble]].
- Use  [[Erik Holmstrand]]'s keycard to enter the facility.
- Hack into the security of the 616B building to disable security.
- Find [[Sharpness V]] on floor 25.

## Choices and Difficulties
- [[Erik Holmstrand]] called in sick, this will give an error at the entrance.
- Keycard gives only 1 person access to only floor 24.
- Floor 24 contains the [[The Amulet of the Undead]].
- They have about 30 minutes - 1hr before security arrives.
