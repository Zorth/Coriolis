# Characteristics
The [[Odindome]] is a racing circuit in [[Fjord]].
It holds a powerful artifact called [[The Mask]]. The [[Valkyrie]] were recruited by the [[Pearl of Power]] to raid the [[Odindome]] for this artifact but they were stopped by [[Eleanor Skyword]] from [[Sylvaray]].

The circuit was never fully opened and now lies closed and guarded by [[CLIP]] soldiers.
