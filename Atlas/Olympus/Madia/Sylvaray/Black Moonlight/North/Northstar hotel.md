# Characteristics
The Northstar hotel is a cube hotel located in the north part of [[Black Moonlight]], close to [[Svides Bar]].

## Address
166R Letron St.
North Black Moonlight

> [!NOTE] Cube Hotel
> Cube Hotels are located in Zones with Corporate, Moderate, and Combat Threat Ratings. This is by far the cheapest way to live in the city. You live in a single windowless room with a nice strong lock where you can touch both walls if you spread your arms. Flatpack furniture folds out of the walls, converting your cell from a chair with a desk to a bed with a small television. Living here, you can't realistically have more things than you could carry at any given time, plus the contents of a backpack you can safely store behind the bed when it folds into the wall. Sleeping with more than one person in a cube is always sleeping uncomfortable and will leave you fatigued the next day (You have -2 to everything you attempt while fatigued). Down the hall, past all of your equally compacted neighbors, there is a common room that has running water and a bathroom with a shower. Even going near this common room is a bad idea unless you are properly gang affiliated. Most people keep three water bottles in their rooms just to avoid entering the common room. There's a single window on the opposite side of the cell block where these bottles are emptied. If you own a vehicle and you live here, you likely park it on the street.
