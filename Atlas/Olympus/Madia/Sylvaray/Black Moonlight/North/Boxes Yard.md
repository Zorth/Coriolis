# Characteristics
Boxes Yard is a cargo container renting facility in [[Black Moonlight]].

> [!NOTE] Cargo Containers
Cargo Containers are located in the Suburbs, Reclaimed Perimeter, and the Combat Zone. You'll have plenty of places to store your things, a bed to sleep comfortably, a desk, electricity, a refrigerator, microwave, and sink, protected by the security of a strong lock. In the Combat Zone, you'll be in danger the second you step outside, but if you live in the Outskirts, you'll be much safer. Restrooms, Showers, and Laundry are located in facilities you'll share with the residents of other Cargo Containers stacked nearby your container. If you own a vehicle and you live here, you likely park it on the street. If you live in the Combat Zone, it will probably get broken into on occasion. If you chose the Outskirts, it will probably be fine.
