# Characteristics
[[Megabuilding H07]] is one of the abandoned megabuildings initially built by [[Voxhos]]. Situated on the N30 highway in [[Black Moonlight|North Black Moonlight]].

It started construction before the Median war, in 1483. But was unable to complete construction due to the war starting in 1486. After the war ended in 1492, the building fell into the hands of [[Sylvaray]], who abandoned construction after trying to recover the building for 10 years.

# Layout
The building counts 60 floors above ground and 3 floors below. The floors below consist of foundations and logistics of the building, they should be (re-)activated in order for operations to work.

Higher floors are constructed from 15 floor blocks, in the following order:
