The collapse is an event started because the [[Magnificent Misfits]] died when they saved the multiverse from collapse. This however, ended up in all of the [[God]]s being killed of if they weren't able to seal their essence in time.

With no [[God]]s to maintain the weave and other magic, the [[Phlogiston]] collapsed and blocked all roads between universes. This left people stranded away from home and magic-users without their powers. Power struggles all over the galaxy caused for a lot of chaos and a great restructuring.
